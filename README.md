# Embedded-Systems
CS-350 Embedded Systems

In this project, the goal was to update the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) code in Code Composer Studio. The objective was to implement a program that would make a TI board blink LEDs in Morse code patterns. The purpose of this project was to learn about embedded systems programming and practice digital communication through visual signals.

What did you do particularly well?
I think the aspects which I did well were the following:
- Understanding what the project was asking me to accomplish
- Writing efficient and clean code in GPIO making sure that the lights did blink in morse code
- Making sure test and debug the code many times

Where could you improve?
- I think I need to remember to get better at documenting things better and including enough commentary within the code
- Exploring and learning how to implement better optimization

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think I definitely would include the resources that are included with Texas Instruments. They seem to have a lot when it comes to resources as well as 
documentation that helps to understand their hardware and specifications. Online communities are also a great tool. I typically use Stack Overflow, facebook groups, as well
as subscriptions to tech articles.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
An understaning of embedded systems and how they function. I also believe I learned some problem solving skills when trying to learn this type of system as well as the software
that we were using. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I did my best to make sure to structure the code into reusable functions and modules. I also did my best to include comments within the code. Included parameters for the LED
configurations so that it can be adapted to other systems.
